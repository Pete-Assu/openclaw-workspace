# Executive Productivity

## Their Reality
- Back-to-back meetings 8am-6pm, zero buffer
- By 3pm: 50+ decisions made, willpower depleted
- No time for strategic thinking — always reactive
- Calendar not fully theirs — others schedule them
- Know they should delegate more, don't trust it'll get done

## What Actually Helps

### Time Architecture
- CEO Ideal Week template: blocks for deep work, 1:1s, external, internal, buffer
- Meeting-free mornings or specific no-meeting days
- 15-minute buffers between meetings are NON-NEGOTIABLE

### Decision Systems
- 2-minute rule: decide now or delegate immediately
- Pre-made policies: "All vendor requests under $5K go to COO"
- Decision batching: group similar decisions together
- Decision journal: track patterns, not just outcomes

### Delegation Framework
Use levels:
- Level 1: You decide, don't tell me
- Level 2: You decide, inform me
- Level 3: Recommend, I'll approve
- Level 4: I'll decide, you execute

Weekly delegation review: what's out, what's due, what's stuck.

### Protected Strategic Time
- 3 hours/week minimum for thinking, not doing
- Schedule it like a meeting with the board
- No phones, no email, just thinking

### Energy Management
- Match task type to energy: creative AM, admin PM
- Shutdown ritual with defined end time
- Weekend recovery is productive, not lazy

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ "Wake up earlier" — they already do
- ❌ "Use a to-do list" — they have 47 lists
- ❌ Individual contributor advice — they need systems for TEAMS
- ❌ 2-hour morning routines — they're in meetings by 7:30am

## Questions to Ask
- "What's on your calendar that shouldn't be?"
- "What decisions are you making that someone else could?"
- "When did you last have 2 uninterrupted hours to think?"
- "What would your ideal week look like?"

# ADHD Productivity

## Their Reality
- Executive dysfunction: KNOW what to do, WANT to do it, CAN'T start
- Time blindness: "5 minutes" and "2 hours" feel identical
- Hyperfocus on the WRONG thing — interesting subtask, not actual priority
- Working memory failures: if it's not written down NOW, it's gone forever
- Emotional dysregulation: mild criticism → hours of spiraling

## What Actually Helps

### Task Initiation
The ONLY hard part is starting. Once they're doing it, they're fine.

**2-minute start**: "Just do 2 minutes. Then you can stop."
**First physical action**: Not "write report" but "open laptop, create new doc, type title"
**Body doubling**: Someone present (even virtually) while they work
**Transition rituals**: Clear signal that one thing ends, another begins

### External Time Scaffolding
They don't feel time passing. You need to TELL them.

- Visible countdown timers (not silent phone alarms)
- "You've been on this for 90 minutes" check-ins
- Time blocking with ADHD-realistic buffers (everything takes longer)
- Body check reminders: "Have you eaten? Moved? Had water?"

### Hyperfocus Management
It's not always productive — often compulsive.

- Gentle check-ins: "Is this still the priority?"
- Permission to stay IF it's the right thing
- Hard stops for basic needs (without judgment)
- Breaking out of hyperfocus hurts — be gentle

### Working Memory Support
- Capture EVERYTHING immediately
- Single inbox, not 12 apps
- Out of sight = out of mind is LITERAL
- Visual reminders in physical space

### Emotional Co-Regulation
- No shame, EVER — neutral tone when they miss things
- "I can't" sometimes means "I literally cannot" not "I won't"
- Celebrate small wins genuinely
- Reframe: "We'll try a different approach" not "You failed"

### ADHD-Specific Techniques
- Temptation bundling: boring task + enjoyable thing
- Novelty injection: rotate systems before they get boring
- Constraint-based work: "You have 15 minutes" beats "do this whenever"
- "Good enough" permission: done > perfect, always

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ "Just use a planner" — they have 47 abandoned planners
- ❌ "Set reminders" — they ignore reminders
- ❌ "Try harder" / "Just focus" — that's the whole problem
- ❌ Complex systems — novelty wears off in 3 days
- ❌ Guilt or shame — makes everything worse
- ❌ Long-term planning without near-term action
- ❌ Neurotypical advice dressed up as universal

## Questions to Ask
- "What's the first tiny physical action?"
- "Do you want accountability or just to vent?"
- "Is starting the problem or finishing?"
- "What worked for you before, even briefly?"

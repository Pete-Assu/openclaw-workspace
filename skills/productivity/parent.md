# Working Parent Productivity

## Their Reality
- 15-minute focus blocks MAX between interruptions
- 47 open browser tabs because nothing finishes in one sitting
- Mental load: school pickup, permission slips, pediatrician, birthday gifts, milk...
- Guilt trifecta: working = guilty about kids, with kids = guilty about work, alone = guilty about both
- "Self-care" feels like a cruel joke
- Productive hours are 9pm-10:30pm when they're already exhausted

## What Actually Helps

### The "Good Enough" Framework
Explicitly define:
- What needs to be done WELL (client deliverable)
- What can be "done badly but done" (kid's lunch)
- What can be skipped entirely (perfect house)

Give permission to lower standards. They need to hear this.

### Time Blocking for Interrupted Lives
Not 2-hour chunks. That's fantasy.
- "Here's what you can do in 15 interrupted minutes"
- "Here's what needs 45 uninterrupted minutes — when can you get that?"
- Strategies for when the block gets destroyed (it WILL)

### Brain Dump → Triage
Quick capture that takes under 30 seconds:
- Voice memo while driving
- Shared note with partner
- Single inbox, not 5 apps

Weekly triage (not daily — no time): urgent vs not, me vs delegate, this week vs someday.

### Energy Tasks for Exhausted Evenings
When they finally sit down at 9pm, don't assign creative work.
- Pre-made list of "low energy" tasks
- Sorting, organizing, routine emails
- Save hard thinking for morning pockets

### Guilt Reframe
- "Good enough parenting" research exists — share it
- Boundaries = modeling healthy behavior for kids
- Recovery isn't selfish, it's sustainable
- Their kids are fine. Really.

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ "Wake up at 5am" — they were up twice with a sick kid
- ❌ Long setup or maintenance systems — won't happen
- ❌ Advice for people with control over their schedule
- ❌ "Just ask your partner to help" — assumes equal load
- ❌ Judgment about screen time, convenience food, anything

## Questions to Ask
- "What's ONE thing you need to finish today?"
- "When's your only uninterrupted time?"
- "What are you doing that you could stop doing?"
- "What would make this week 'good enough'?"

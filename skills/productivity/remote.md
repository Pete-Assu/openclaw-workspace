# Remote Worker Productivity (Multi-Timezone)

## Their Reality
- 3-4 hours overlap with team, consumed entirely by meetings
- Wake up to 200+ unread Slack messages across 15 channels
- "Can we find 30 minutes?" means eating dinner at 9:30pm
- No clear start/end to day — always partially on
- Miss hallway conversations where real decisions happen

## What Actually Helps

### Time-Zone-Aware Blocking
- Identify your overlap window — that's your meeting zone
- Protect everything OUTSIDE overlap for deep work
- Default meeting length: 25 minutes (not 30)
- "I don't take meetings before 10am my time" is a valid boundary

### Async-First Communication
Don't require your whole company to change — you adapt:

**BLUF Method** (Bottom Line Up Front):
- First line: what you need / what you're sharing
- Then context
- Readers in other timezones can skim

**Status Updates That Work:**
- What's done, what's next, what's blocked
- Write once, post to Slack/email/wherever
- Proactive > reactive

**Loom/Video for Complex Topics:**
3-minute video > 15-message thread

### Notification Architecture
- Batch Slack checks: 3x/day, not constant
- Separate "need response today" channel from everything else
- Phone notification OFF for work apps after hours
- "I'll respond during my working hours" is professional, not rude

### Shutdown Ritual
The commute doesn't exist. Create your own transition:
1. Write tomorrow's top 3
2. Close all work tabs
3. Physical action: walk around the block, change clothes
4. Work apps off phone or in different phone "mode"

### Relationship Building
- Use overlap time for human connection, not just status
- Async relationship building: share wins, ask about their weekend
- Intentional 1:1s that aren't all business
- "Watercooler" channels for non-work chat

### Visibility Tactics
Out of sight ≠ out of mind if you're strategic:
- Documentation of your decisions and progress
- Weekly summary of what you shipped
- Demos, screenshots, artifacts

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ Advice designed for same-timezone teams
- ❌ "Optimize your morning routine" — their morning might be someone else's EOD
- ❌ Requiring everyone else to change their behavior
- ❌ Ignoring that their calendar isn't fully theirs
- ❌ "Just don't check Slack" — without replacement system

## Questions to Ask
- "What's your actual overlap window?"
- "What decisions are happening while you sleep?"
- "When do YOU want your workday to end?"
- "What's making you feel like you're always on?"

# Freelancer Productivity

## Their Reality
- No external structure — easy to drift into "busy but not productive"
- 3-5 active clients, each thinking they're the only one
- Context switching between projects destroys focus
- Work bleeds into evenings/weekends — no "office closing time"
- Isolation: no coworkers, no accountability, no one to vent to

## What Actually Helps

### Daily Structure Templates
Example day:
- 8-9am: Admin (email, invoices, quick tasks)
- 9am-12pm: Deep work block (hardest client work)
- 12-1pm: Lunch + break (actual break, not "working lunch")
- 1-4pm: Second work block
- 4-5pm: Client comms, planning tomorrow
- After 5pm: OFF

They won't follow it perfectly. That's fine. The structure provides gravity.

### Client Management
- Status update templates: "Here's where we are, here's what's next, here's what I need from you"
- Scope creep scripts: "Happy to add that! It's outside our original scope, so I'll send a quick estimate."
- Office hours: "I respond to messages M-F 9am-5pm"

### Context Switching Protocol
- Don't jump between clients randomly
- Theme days if possible: Client A Mon/Wed, Client B Tue/Thu
- At minimum: morning = one client, afternoon = another
- 10-minute transition buffer between clients

### Invoice Immediately
Tie invoicing to project milestones. Don't batch monthly — you'll delay and hurt cash flow.

### Combat Isolation
- Virtual coworking sessions (Focusmate, body doubling)
- Weekly accountability partner check-in
- Leave the house: coffee shop, library, coworking space

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ Corporate productivity advice — assumes teams and managers
- ❌ "Just use a calendar" — they know, enforcement is the problem
- ❌ Ignoring the emotional/isolation side
- ❌ Complex systems requiring daily maintenance

## Questions to Ask
- "How many clients are you juggling right now?"
- "When does work 'end' for you?"
- "What's your biggest time sink that isn't actual work?"
- "When's the last time you took a real day off?"

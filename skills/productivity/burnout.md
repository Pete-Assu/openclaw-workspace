# Burnout Recovery

## Their Reality
- Dread opening their laptop
- Interrupted every 23 minutes, can't rebuild context
- Imposter syndrome: everyone else seems to ship faster
- "Quick question" DMs at 9pm that are never quick
- Physical symptoms: headaches by 3pm, can't sleep, forgot to eat
- Weekend is "recovery mode" not actual rest

## What Actually Helps

### Immediate Relief
**The "Not Today" List**
Explicit permission to defer. Write down what you're NOT doing today. Relief comes from decision, not completion.

**Context-Switching Cost**
Show them the math: 8 fragmented hours ≠ 4 focused hours. This validates their experience.

**Emergency Shutdown Ritual**
Define exactly how the workday ends:
1. Write tomorrow's top 3
2. Close all tabs
3. Specific phrase: "The workday is complete"
4. Phone goes somewhere else

### Sustainable Practices

**Minimum Viable Workday**
What's the 80/20? What's the bare minimum that keeps the job while recovering?

**Energy Management**
- When are they capable of deep work? (Hint: probably not after 3pm)
- Match tasks to energy, not the clock
- "Low energy" task list for fried days

**The "Good Enough" Standard**
Permission to ship B+ work instead of A+. Perfect is the enemy of sustainable.

### Mindset Shifts

**Burnout is a Systems Problem**
The environment is broken, not them. This isn't a personal failure.

**Deliberate Incompetence**
Strategically being "bad" at things so people stop asking. You can't do everything.

**Productivity ≠ Worth**
Output this week means nothing if they quit in 3 months. Sustainability is the goal.

### Recovery Protocols

**Burnout Severity Check**
- Tired = rest helps, energy returns
- Burnout = rest doesn't help, cynicism, detachment
- If rest doesn't help → professional support needed

**Weekend Recovery Template**
- Day 1: Nothing productive. Actually nothing.
- Day 2: One enjoyable activity, one small chore
- Avoid "productive relaxation" (learning, side projects)

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ "Try the Pomodoro technique" — interruptions don't respect timers
- ❌ "Just wake up earlier" — they already can't sleep
- ❌ More optimization — they need LESS, not more efficient MORE
- ❌ Toxic positivity — "you got this!" when they clearly don't
- ❌ Generic self-care — "take a bath" doesn't fix systemic overwork

## Questions to Ask
- "When did you last have a day you didn't think about work?"
- "Does rest actually help, or do you feel the same after?"
- "What would change if you did 20% less?"
- "Is this tired or is this burnout?"

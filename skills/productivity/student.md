# Student Productivity

## Their Reality
- Deadlines scattered across platforms (Canvas, Moodle, email, Discord)
- "I work better under pressure" → panic at 2am
- Phone is the enemy — notifications destroy momentum
- Motivation hits at 11pm when it's too late to start
- Guilt spiral: procrastinate → feel guilty → procrastinate more

## What Actually Helps

### Task Breakdown
Don't say "write essay." Break it:
1. Open Google Doc, write ONE sentence about topic
2. Find 3 sources (just find, don't read)
3. Read source 1, highlight 5 quotes
4. Write rough outline (bullet points only)
5. ...

First step must be stupidly small. "Open the document" counts.

### Realistic Time Estimates
- They underestimate everything by 2-3x
- "This will take 2 hours" → plan for 5
- Ask: "When's it due? How many actual hours? Do you have that many hours left?"

### Energy-Based Scheduling
- Don't tell them to wake up at 6am — they won't
- Find THEIR peak hours (probably 10am-12pm or 8pm-10pm)
- Schedule hard tasks there, admin during low energy

### The 2-Minute Start
"Do 2 minutes of the task. If you still want to stop after 2 minutes, stop."
They won't stop. Getting started is the only hard part.

### Deadline Aggregation
Help them see ALL deadlines in one view. The scattered platforms are killing them.

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ "Just start" — they KNOW
- ❌ Complex productivity systems — too much overhead
- ❌ Rigid schedules — one missed day = abandoned
- ❌ Guilt trips — they're already drowning in guilt
- ❌ Morning routines — their sleep is chaos

## Questions to Ask
- "What's due first and when?"
- "What's the smallest possible first step?"
- "When do you actually have energy?"
- "What's getting in the way of starting?"

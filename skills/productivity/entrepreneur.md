# Entrepreneur Productivity

## Their Reality
- CEO, developer, marketer, salesperson, support, accountant — before lunch
- Shiny object syndrome: every podcast suggests a new "growth hack"
- No team = no accountability, easy to hide in comfortable tasks
- Runway pressure: 8 months left, every hour matters
- Default to building when they should be selling

## What Actually Helps

### The ONE Thing Filter
"What's the single most important thing for revenue this week?"
Not 10 goals. ONE. Everything else is secondary.

### Build vs. Sell Tracker
Most founders spend 90% building, 10% distributing. It should be closer to 50/50.
- Track time in each category
- If it's been 3 days of pure building → force a sales activity

### Anti-Shiny-Object Filter
Before ANY new initiative:
"Does this directly lead to revenue or retention in the next 30 days?"
If no → it's a distraction. Write it down for later, move on.

### ICE Scoring for Solo Founders
Rate each task:
- Impact (revenue potential)
- Confidence (will it actually work?)
- Effort (time required)

Runway adjusts the formula: less runway = higher weight on speed.

### Scary Task Protocol
They're avoiding something (sales calls, pricing conversations, hard emails).
Break it into a 15-minute first step:
- "List 5 people to contact" (not "do cold outreach")
- "Draft the pricing page copy" (not "figure out pricing")

### Weekly Honest Review
- What did I avoid this week? Why?
- What's the real blocker?
- Am I telling myself I'm "busy" to avoid something hard?

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ OKRs and corporate frameworks — overkill for solo founders
- ❌ Complex systems requiring daily maintenance
- ❌ Generic Pomodoro/GTD they've read 100 times
- ❌ Ignoring emotional reality: fear, imposter syndrome, loneliness
- ❌ "Hustle harder" — they're already hustling

## Questions to Ask
- "Is what you're doing right now the highest-leverage use of your limited time?"
- "When's the last time you talked to a customer?"
- "What are you avoiding?"
- "If you had to pick ONE thing for this week, what would move the needle most?"

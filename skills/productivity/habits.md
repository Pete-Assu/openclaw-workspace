# Habit Building

## Their Reality
- Day 1-5: massive enthusiasm
- Day 10: "forgot" twice
- Day 14: quietly abandoned, guilt every time they think about it
- All-or-nothing: miss one day = "streak broken, might as well give up"
- No external accountability — nobody knows they're trying

## What Actually Helps

### Proactive Check-Ins (The Killer Feature)
Don't wait for them to report. Reach out at strategic moments:
- **Day 3**: "How's [habit] going? Any friction?"
- **Day 7**: "You've done this a week! What almost made you skip?"
- **Day 14**: "This is statistically when people quit. You're still here."
- **Day 21+**: Less frequent but still present

### Never-Miss-Twice Rule
One miss is an accident. Two is the start of a new (bad) habit.

Teach this explicitly. It's the most powerful reframe. A single miss doesn't break anything — the SECOND miss does.

### Implementation Intentions
Not "I'll exercise more" but:
"I will do 10 pushups in my bedroom at 7:15am after I brush my teeth."

Specific: time, location, cue. Force this specificity.

### The 2-Minute Rule
Scale it down until it takes 2 minutes:
- "Run 5km" → "Put on running shoes and step outside"
- "Meditate 20 minutes" → "Sit on cushion, take 3 breaths"
- "Read every night" → "Read one page"

Tiny is sustainable. Ambitious fails.

### Habit Stacking
"After I [existing habit], I will [new habit]."

Help them find their anchors:
- What do you already do every morning without thinking?
- Attach the new thing to the existing thing.

### Identity, Not Behavior
Shift from "I want to run" to "I'm becoming someone who runs."

The behavior follows the identity, not the other way around.

### Friction Audit
What makes the habit HARD? Environment design, not willpower:
- Gym clothes laid out the night before
- Phone in another room
- Book on pillow instead of phone

### Recovery Protocol
When they miss multiple days:
1. No shame — acknowledge it happened
2. Identify what broke (travel? stress? schedule change?)
3. Make the habit SMALLER, not same size
4. Tomorrow is a new streak — not "starting over"

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ Waiting for them to check in — they'll forget and feel guilty
- ❌ "Just be consistent" — that's the whole problem
- ❌ 30-day challenges — creates finish line instead of lifestyle
- ❌ Guilt when they miss — shame spirals don't help
- ❌ Tracking without intervention — dashboards aren't accountability

## Questions to Ask
- "What habit are you trying to build?"
- "What happened the last time you tried?"
- "What's the 2-minute version of this habit?"
- "What existing habit can you attach this to?"

# Creative Productivity

## Their Reality
- Blank page feels hostile — starting is the hardest part
- Best ideas come at 2am, in shower, while walking — never during "creative time"
- Traditional productivity systems feel like cages
- Perfectionism: hours polishing one paragraph instead of finishing
- After a creative session, they're DEPLETED — can't just switch tasks

## What Actually Helps

### Permission to Start Badly
- "Ugly first draft" is the goal
- "Write one terrible sentence" not "write for 2 hours"
- Separate create and edit sessions — NEVER both at once
- "This is v1, not the forever version"

### Rhythms, Not Schedules
- "I tend to write in the morning" ≠ "9-11am writing block"
- Flexible structure that bends without breaking
- Weekly themes instead of daily rigidity

### Warm-Up Rituals
Non-creative signals that trigger creative mode:
- Specific music, tea, environment
- Morning pages: dump the junk before real work
- 5-minute freewrite to get the gears turning

### Energy Categories
- Creative (high energy): actual making
- Administrative (medium): emails, planning, scheduling
- Recovery (low): walking, reading, doing nothing

Transition rituals between modes. Don't jump from admin to creative.

### Capture Everything
Best ideas come at weird times. Systems to grab them:
- Voice memos (fastest)
- Pocket notebook
- Single notes app, not 12

### Shipping Deadlines
- External accountability to force "done, not perfect"
- Someone waiting for it
- Public commitment if they need pressure

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ Pomodoro for creative work — flow doesn't care about 25 minutes
- ❌ Rigid time blocks — inspiration doesn't follow schedules
- ❌ "Corporate" productivity — KPIs, quarterly goals
- ❌ Treating creative work like assembly line work
- ❌ Ignoring the emotional component of making things

## Questions to Ask
- "When do you actually feel creative?"
- "What's stopping you from starting?"
- "What's the smallest piece you could finish today?"
- "Are you blocked or just scared it won't be good?"

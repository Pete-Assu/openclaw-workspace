# Manager Productivity

## Their Reality
- 6-8 direct reports = 6-8 hours/week minimum for 1:1s
- Context switching: code review → standup → 1:1 → incident → hiring call
- Team productivity vs personal productivity tension
- Go into 1:1s cold — can't remember last discussion
- Still want to do IC work sometimes, rarely get the chance

## What Actually Helps

### 1:1 System
**Before each 1:1:**
- 5-minute prep reviewing their recent work
- Agenda with their items first, yours second
- Reference notes from last conversation

**During 1:1:**
- Listen more than talk
- "What's blocking you?" gets real answers
- Career development isn't optional

**After 1:1:**
- Action items captured with clear owners
- Quick note: what was discussed, what was decided

**1:1 Memory:**
Persistent notes per person. "Last time we discussed X, how did that go?"

### Maker vs Manager Schedule
Track the ratio. If it's 90% manager, something's wrong.

- Defend at least one 3-hour IC block per week
- Manager time: batch meetings together
- Maker time: consecutive, no interruptions

### Context Switch Mitigation
- Theme days if possible (Tues/Thurs = meeting heavy, Mon/Wed = maker time)
- Minimum 15-minute buffer between different-mode tasks
- "Quick question" has a queue — answer during office hours, not immediately

### Team Visibility Without Micromanagement
- Daily standup async: Slack thread or written update
- "What did your team accomplish this week?" answer ready always
- Dashboard of project status, not constant check-ins

### Delegation Levels
Not everything needs your approval:
- Level 1: Decide and do, don't tell me
- Level 2: Decide and do, inform me
- Level 3: Decide, wait for my OK
- Level 4: Bring me options, I'll decide

Be explicit about which level each type of decision is.

### Energy Awareness
- Don't schedule hard conversations back-to-back
- Morning for strategic, afternoon for administrative
- Friday afternoon ≠ time for difficult feedback

## What Doesn't Help
- ❌ Personal productivity tips that ignore team responsibility
- ❌ "Inbox zero" when your inbox is other people's blockers
- ❌ IC productivity advice — you're not an IC anymore
- ❌ Ignoring the emotional labor of management
- ❌ Treating 1:1s as "overhead" to minimize

## Questions to Ask
- "When did you last have 2+ hours for deep work?"
- "What decisions are you making that should be delegated?"
- "Are your 1:1s useful or just ritual?"
- "What would your team say about how available you are?"
